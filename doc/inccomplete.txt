1. Description 					*inccomplete-description*

This is a completion plugin for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ preprocessors include
directive.  It can be used along with clang_complete plugin
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302).
And maybe with some others that I haven't tested.

It can complete both "" and <> forms of #include.

"" Completion~

For "" it gets all header files in the current directory (so it's assumed that
you have something similar to >
    autocmd BufEnter,BufWinEnter * lcd %:p:h
or >
    set autochdir
in your .vimrc).

<> Completion~

For <> it gets all files that have hpp or h extensions or don't have any.

Sources for <> completion are:
- 'path' option (on *nix it's set to '/usr/include' by default, but on Windows
  you should set it to the right directories manually)
- g:clang_user_options ('-I' keys)
- b:clang_user_options ('-I' keys)

Note: current directory won't be used even if it present in one of sources.

Completion of subdirectories~

Only files of include directories are displayed in completion list, but you
can complete files in subdirectories of include directories too. All you need
is to call completion again after typing subdirectory name and slash (and
maybe beginning of file name).

2. Configuration				*inccomplete-configuration*

command to run GNU find program			*inccomplete-findcmd*
						*g:inccomplete_findcmd*
                                                 type: string
						 default: "find"

Note: On Windows you need to have Cygwin installed and to set full path to
      find utility. For example, like this: >
      let g:inccomplete_findcmd = 'c:/cygwin/bin/find'
<     Or it can be any find utility that accepts the following
      parameters and multiple search paths: >
      -maxdepth 1 -type f
<

how to add close bracket			*inccomplete-addclosebracket*
						*g:inccomplete_addclosebracket*
                                                 type: string
						 default: "always"

When this option equals "always" close bracket will be added right after open
bracket was pressed. Otherwise it will be added after completion is over.

how to sort completion list			*inccomplete-sort*
						*g:inccomplete_sort*
						 type: string
						 default: ""

When this option equals "ignorecase" the case of letters of filenames will be
ignored.

==============================================================================
3. ToDo						*inccomplete-todo*

- Maybe 'path' option should be replaced with some global variable like
  g:inccomplete_incpath?
- Is it possible to do file searching using only VimL?
- Maybe '.' in path should be automatically replaced with the path to current
  buffer instead of assuming that working directory is correct?
